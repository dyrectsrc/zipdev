# Zipdev - Front-end Code Challenge - Pierre Besson

You should be able to just open index.html and see my solution right away.

Just incase that does not work try this.


Install all packages:
```
$ npm install
```

Run webpack
```
$ npm run build
```

Done! Open index.html in the browser and checkout my solution to the challenge.

### How I approached this challenge

I only used Javascript, HTML5, implemented SCSS, and used Webpack as package bundler. I didnt use any frameworks or libraries.

When writing code front end I like to start from the front and work my way backwards. In other words I worked on the html and css first and came up with the look and feel of the site. 

I chose to use radio buttons for the first question. I chose to use checkboxes for the second questions. And textboxes for questions number 3 and 4. 

I created functions for the next buttons, radio buttons for question 1, check boxes for question 2, palindrome word for question 3, palindrome sentences for question 4, and counter.

I chose to use CSS Grid for the questions and zomato list results.

### Requisites

## Show one question at time, and click the next button for showing the next image

I created a function called next in javascript that hid and showed the appropriate question by changing the CSS display: hide and display: block properties

## Create a general progress bar at the bottom of the quiz (will fulfill the entire progress bar when you answer the last question)

I used the next function and javascript to grow a bar as the user progresses using CSS.

## Ten seconds timer for the first two questions

I created a countdown function to add to the first 2 questions

## Responsive design

I chose css grid to assist in a responsive design.

## Provide your code in a git-based repository
